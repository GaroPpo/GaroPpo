# Hi there, I'm Eric Liputra 👋

As a young, driven professional, I am deeply passionate about tackling challenges and expanding my knowledge in various disciplines, including computer science. As a team player, I am also able to work independently when necessary.

My interest in website development began during my second year of senior high school when I was inspired by a friend's creation of a Blogspot. Despite limited access to the internet, I purchased a beginner's guide to Blogspot to fuel my passion for programming. Since then, I have continued to develop my skills in website development, progressing from editing my Blogspot's style to creating simple static websites from scratch and eventually learning to create WordPress themes. While my focus is primarily on front-end development, I remain open to learning about back-end development as well.

Although my current career may seem to diverge from my background in computer science, I remain committed to coding in my free time, most recently creating a company profile website for a local business. My drive to learn and grow in this industry is insatiable.

Last but not least, I appreciate your time for a visit on my profile, although there's nothing special here so far 😄. Looking forward to add more project on my GitHub! ✌️ Cheers from Indonesia!

🌱 I’m currently learning React.js & Flutter
