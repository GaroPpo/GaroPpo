# Hi there, I'm Eric Liputra 👋

My passion for website development started during my senior year of high school when I was inspired by a friend's creation of a Blogspot. Since then, I have been continuously developing my skills in website development, progressing from editing my Blogspot's style to creating simple static websites from scratch and eventually learning to create WordPress themes. While I primarily focus on front-end development, I am also open to learning about back-end development.

Thank you for visiting my profile 😄, and I look forward to adding more projects to my GitHub in the future! ✌️ Cheers from Indonesia!

🌱 I’m currently learning React.js & Flutter
